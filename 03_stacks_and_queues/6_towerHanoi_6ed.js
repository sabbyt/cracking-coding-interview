// Question 3.4 (6th Edition)
// In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and Ndisks
// of different sizes which can slide on to any tower. The puzzle starts with
// disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (i.e., each disk
// sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:

//  (1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
//  (2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next tower.
//  (3) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.

// Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using
// stacks.
